## Usage

### Setting Up Vault Mappings

3. Enter the vault name as it appears in obsidian:// URLs
4. Browse to or enter the local path to that vault
5. Optionally enable "Copy Locally" for offline access
6. Add a description for reference

### Mapping from Links

1. Select an `obsidian://` link in your editor
2. Right-click and choose "Map Vault"
3. Configure the vault location in the dialog
4. The plugin will remember this mapping for future use

### Example Workflow

Given an obsidian link like:
```
obsidian://open?vault=MyProject&file=Meeting%20Notes
```

1. The plugin will look for a vault mapping named "MyProject"
2. If mapped, it will display the file with visual indicators
3. Hover to preview the content
4. Click to open the file (or local copy if cached)
5. If unmapped, the link shows an error state with quick mapping options

## Settings

### Default Copy Locally
When enabled, new vault mappings will default to copying files locally for offline access.
