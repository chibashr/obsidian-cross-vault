```json
{
  "vaultMappings": {
    "VaultName": "/path/to/vault"
  },
  "enableLocalCopy": {
    "VaultName": true

```
obsidian://open?vault=VaultName&file=FileName
```

Where:
- `VaultName` is the name of the target vault
- `FileName` is the name of the file (without .md extension)

## Limitations

- Desktop only (file system access required)
- Requires manual vault mapping setup
- Cross-vault files open in read-only mode within the current vault context
